# Cinematic Conversation Camera

Skyrim dialogue camera mod. Cut between the player and NPC, choose camera
angles, and adjust framing, movement and dialogue presentation.

## Setup

Close Skyrim and install with MO2 or Vortex, then start the game through SKSE.
Open **Cinematic Conversation Camera** in SKSE Menu Framework to change settings,
or edit `Data/SKSE/Plugins/SD.ini`. Menu settings save to `SD_user.ini`.
Keep that file when updating.

Requires Skyrim SE/AE, matching SKSE and Address Library. SKSE Menu Framework
is optional. Dragonborn ReVoiced 1.4.4 or newer is recommended for player voice
timing and lip sync. DBVO 1 and 2 are also supported.

Keep SmoothCam enabled. Improved Camera users playing in first person need
`bScripted=0` in its profile. Disable other dialogue-camera mods.
See [compatibility and settings](USAGE.md).

No ESP or Papyrus scripts. Nothing is written to your save.

Version 1.4.6 caches settings between conversations. The build and 16 tests pass;
in-game performance testing is still needed. The reported dialogue exit/re-entry
control lock remains unresolved.
